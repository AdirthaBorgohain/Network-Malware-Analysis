# Network-Malware-Analysis

Several different types of models have been developed over the years for detecting malicious programs/softwares.
Most of these models however, perform static analysis in which
the code under inspection is semantically matched with a predefined malware template. Due to camouflage and different obfuscation techniques used in creating malwares, many malwares go
undetected. In order to build a more efficient malware detection
model, in this paper, we propose a model that can be used
to detect malicious activity at the network level. The network
activity of a system is analyzed and based on specific patterns and
activities, the traffic is classified as being benign or malicious. In
our model, we use an ensemble of three gradient boosting models

XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM. Ensembling is done in such
a way that maximum weightage is given to the boosting model
that has the best performance individually and subsequently the
other boosting models are given appropriate weightage. In order
to determine the weightages to be given, a logistic regression
model is used with the outputs of the individual boosting models
used as features to be given to the regression model. Our
proposed model achieves a high classification accuracy (99.97%)
and minimal number of false negatives (0.014%). Differently
sized training data were considered for different experiments
in other to evaluate proper learning rates depending on different
data sizes.
